TODO APP ðŸ’«
Here is the link to my Todo: https://annirubi.github.io/todo-app/

Files attached are index.html, styles.css, main.js

I created the app which allows to input a todo that gets included into the todo-list and saved on the page. You may delete a todo or click "completed". 

I`ve worked with LocalStorage so that all todos remain saved on the page after page refresh. 

In main.js there are:
- functions;
- addEventListener;
- elements created;
- methods like "append", "splice", "forEach" etc.
- JSON.parse and JSON.stringify


What is remained:
- to add "Delete all" button;
- to add the date
